>
> I used inline CSS code for basic formatting. I really can't help it I am OCD about this 
and it can't help myself. 

>## _Project Explained_
>
> This is a project that I have been thinking of for years. In 2020 I purchased the website 
mc-cooks.com with the intentions of deploying the site. I will say that the main page content 
was published on that website. The website is wordpress and it was never what I wanted, it was 
what I could use at the time. 

> - Index.html - Home page 
> - Recipes.html - Showcase for feature dishes 
> - Recipe1.html - is the Lemon Cream Pasta recipe 
> - Recipe2.html - is the Shirmp Thia Currey Soup recipe 
> - Blogspot.html - is a blog about Chicken Broth and a childhood memory 
> - Broth.html - is the ingredient list for Chicken Broth 
> - Contact.html - is the my contact page. 

> Every page has an image and at least two (2) differnet header h1 and h2.  The broth page uses 
a table to display the ingredient list. And last but not lease the contact page utilizes the Form to 
input data into the system. Please note the links on the Blogspot page for Ingredients and the link 
in the last paragraph to TasteofHome.com.
